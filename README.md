# Currency
  Should exchange cash, we use VND (Việt Nam Đồng), 1USD ~ 22,355 VND
  [rate](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=1+USD+in+VND&oq=1+USD+in+VND&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.3959j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8)

  You can use Master Card in coffeeshop, restautant or Taxi, but better to have some cash.

# Power

  We use this one

# Communication

  Phone number: should buy a Sim, register 4G (no ID needed)

  Language: Vietnamese. In Dist1 and Airport, people use English a lot, so don't worry.

# Hotel

  Go to booking website (e.g http://www.agoda.com/)
  Personally, I think use Airbnb in Ho Chi Minh isn't a smart choice.

# Medicine & Face mask

  You can buy medicine & facemask easily in the medical care, these stores are in the hospital or around the street.
  Should wear facemask when traveling because of the pollution.
