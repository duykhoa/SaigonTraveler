# Travel
  - Taxi:
    - There are 2 most famous local taxi brand. You can call them: **Mai Linh** (08) 38383838, **Vina Sun** (08) 38.272727

    - Grab & Uber: by app

    **NOTES**

      - After book a grab car or grab bike, they will call you. Make sure your phone number is updated to local number.
        Most likely they cancel your booking if they can't make a call.
      - I prefer using grab (bike or car), it's more common than Uber.

  - Motobike (xe ôm)

    - Uber moto, Grab bike are new xe ôm service. They are both cheap and safe, you should try.

  - Cyclo: if you want to travel around Ben Thanh Market while laying down to a comfortable chair, and definitely environment friendly.

# Currency

  Should exchange cash, we use VND (Việt Nam Đồng), 1USD ~ 22,713 VND (12 Nov 2017, 1:32 PM)

  I often exchange money from [this place](https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/Desk+Currency+Exchange+59/@10.775573,106.7034425,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8322cc2ec51b2e6a?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsmZrZprjXAhUOSo8KHW-8AcUQ_BIImgEwCg) (may be)

  If staying in Ho Chi Minh City for few days, I suggest you exchange money here, the rate is better.

  When you arrive to Tan Son Nhat Internation Airport, just exchange enough money for taxi, sim card (~40$/person).

  You can use Master Card in coffeeshop, restautant or Taxi, but better to have some cash. Master, Visa, Nets, paywave haven't become common yet.

# Power

  We use type C & E/F (2 legs electric plug, round & square).

# Communication

  Phone number: definitely a Sim card with 3G registered (no ID needed). You will need it for booking taxi, translation, map.

  Language: Vietnamese. In Dist1 and Airport, people also use English.

# Hotel

  Go to booking website (for example: http://www.agoda.com/)

  I prefer stay in Hotel more than homestay in Viet name, though some homestays' service are very good.

# Medicine & Face mask

  In Viet Nam, we can buy medicine & facemask easily in any pharmacy.

  Just go alongs any street, you definitely can find them.

  I recommend to wear facemask when traveling because of the pollution.

# Coffee & Tea

  Saigon has a [fanstatic coffee culture](http://www.adventurefaktory.com/vietnam-hcmc-coffeeculture/). People loves drinking coffee, discussing work & life, or reading book and working.

  There are 2 kind of coffee beans in Viet Nam, Robusta and Arabica. And less than 10% coffee shops use Arabica beans.

  You can find Robusta coffee in any coffee shop. There are 3 kind of coffee drinks

  - Đen đá: Black coffee with ice, serve in "Phin"
  - Nâu đá: Coffee with milk, serve in "Phin"
  - Bạc sỉu: Coffee with more milk

  "Phin" is special type of coffee filter.

  <img src="https://vietnamcoffee.asia/uploads/ca-phe/2016_01/van-hoa-ca-phe-pha-phin-viet-nam_3.jpg" height="300">

  For Arabica coffee drinker, there are less options than. I add an `!` for arabica coffeeshop. It is not 100% accurate. I haven't visited all of them also.
